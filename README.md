## Downloading and Activating the Environment

The steps are the following:

1. Using Anaconda prompt navigate into the root directory where the `environment.yml` file is present.
2. Run the following command in the Anaconda prompt to create the environment using this `environment.yml` file:

   ```{bash}
   conda env create -p ./venv -f environment.yml
   ```

   This creates a environment called `venv` in this root directory.
3. Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command.

   ```{bash}
   conda activate ./venv
   ```

4. To deactivate the environment, simply run the following:

   ```{bash}
   conda deactivate
   ```
